            <p>The Pontiac LeMans /ləˈmɑːnz/ is a model name that was applied to subcompact- 
                and intermediate-sized automobiles marketed by Pontiac from 1961 to 1981 (1983 in Canada) 
                model years. Originally a trim upgrade based on the Tempest, 
                it became a separate model. In 1964 the Tempest was available with an optional 
                GTO package that later became a separate model, the Pontiac GTO, muscle car. 
                1970 introduced the GT-37 package.

                The Pontiac Catalina is a full-size automobile produced by Pontiac from 1950 to 1981. 
                Initially, the name was a trim line on hardtop body styles, first appearing in the 
                1950 Chieftain Eight and DeLuxe Eight lines. In 1959, it became a separate model as the 
                "entry-level" full-size Pontiac.

                The Pontiac Parisienne is a full-size rear-wheel drive vehicle that was sold by 
                Pontiac on the GM B platform in Canada from 1958 to 1986 and in the United States 
                from 1983 to 1986. Right-hand drive models were locally assembled in Australia, 
                New Zealand, and South Africa until 1969. For most of its run, the Canadian Parisienne 
                was nearly mechanically identical to the American Chevrolet Impala or Chevrolet Caprice. 
                The Parisienne wagon continued under the Safari nameplate until 1989. Parisienne or La 
                Parisienne means a grammatically female person or thing from Paris, France.
